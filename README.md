# English_Spell_Checker- 
the first folder (Creating Dict) consists of the dictionary (list of words collected from internet) and the code to convert it into lexicon of our required format and store it in CSV format to retrieve later. 

the second folder (Reading Dict) consist of the CSV created in the earlier programme and the final programme(final.cpp) to use it as a Lexicon for suggesting the corrected spelling for the entered query. 

Pls keep the CSV file in the same location as that of  code to check the final code.
